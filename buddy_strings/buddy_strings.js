// Given two strings A and B of lowercase letters, return true 
// if you can swap two letters in A so the result is equal to B, otherwise, return false.

// Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) 
// such that i != j and swapping the characters at A[i] and A[j]. 
// For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".

 

// Example 1:

// Input: A = "ab", B = "ba"
// Output: true
// Explanation: You can swap A[0] = 'a' and A[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to B.

var buddyStrings = function(A, B) {
